### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In the search input field you can type in your food of choice

Functionality I would like to have implemented:

The response/results would then get sorted by calories from least to greatest, the data would then get mapped over and displayed.
